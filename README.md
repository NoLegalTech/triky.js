## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need:

* [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/)

### Installing

Just clone this repo and you have it :-)

### Basic use

Run:

```bash

It will ask you the url, but if you prefer a non-interactive way, you can use the `--url` parameter, for example:

```bash
    gulp --url http://www.google.com
```
